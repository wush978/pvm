## Feature

- Export the version of installed packages to a simple [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file via `export.packages`.
- Install the exported packages with given version and their dependencies from CRAN(latest or source) or [MRAN](https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/)(outdated binary)
  according to the YAML file via `import.packages`.

## Install

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wush978/pvm")
```

## Usage

In the original workspace:

```r
pvm::export.packages()
```

- It will check the dependencies and export to `pvm.yml`.
- The exported yaml, the `pvm.yml`, file should be like this:
```
ABCoptim: 0.13.11
Rcpp: 0.12.9
```
- Only version is specified if you want to install the package from CRAN/MRAN
- If you have non-CRAN packages, please modify the content of `pvm.yml`.
    - Change the repository from CRAN to the appropriate specification. Please see [#non-cran-repositories] for examples.
    - Some `DESCRIPTION` files of the local package will include the non-CRAN info. `export.packages` will automatically export
them as non-CRAN.



Then go to another workspace:

```r
pvm::import.packages()
```

- Install the packages via the followign rules
    - Search the binary/source package from CRAN/MRAN if the version is specified in the YAML. The users could specify if they want to install them from `source` or `both`.
    - List all non-listed dependencies and install the latest version of them from CRAN
    - Install the specified packages in YAML with the specified version from CRAN/MRAN/non-CRAN repositories

## Non-CRAN Repositories

Here are examples of specifications of this package:

- github: `github::wush978/pvm`
- bitbucket: `bitbucket::wush978/pvm`
- url: `url::https://github.com/wush978/pvm/archive/master.zip`
- svn: `svn::svn://github.com/wush978/pvm/trunk`
- git: `git::git://github.com/wush978/pvm.git`

That is to say, you should see the following paragraph in `pvm.yml` if you export a non-CRAN `pvm` package:

```yml
pvm: github::wush978/pvm
```
